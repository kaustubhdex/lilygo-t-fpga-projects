List of projects I am doing on lilygo t-fpga board
Lilygo's T-FPGA board consists of an on-board Gowin FPGA (GW1NSR-LV4CQN48PC6/I5) along with ESP-32 S3 series board.
Recommended toolchain for FPGA is the latest Gowin software along with cloudsim to verify FPGA design.
For ESP32 recommended toolchain is ESP-IDF. But if you have a lighter application you can go for Arduino IDE. 
You also have an option of Smowcode software. It is built on the ESP-IDF framework. Very user-friendly if you are starting new.
Find below list of projects:
1. simple-esp32-fpga-adder is repo where i created adder on fpga and verified its logic via esp32. arduino IDE and Gowin softwares were used.
2. soda-dispenser-machine-whole is a literal soda dispenser machine to be tested via FPGA. we can call it a primitive ASIC design simulation.
3. tfpga-UART-loopback.~~
4. tfpga-UART-FFT.~~
